# nth-degree-polynomial-equation
finding a numerical solution of a polynomial equation of the nth degree given on the interval.

with a combined method of chords and tangents.

the user can set the coefficients of the polynomial in the code, in the variable "polynomial" 

and also set the interval for searching in the variable "limits".
